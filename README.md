## Abstract
Due to the prevalence of web browsing, it is common for users of all age groups to encounter CAPTCHAs. We want to know how people of different ages react to different CAPTCHAs. 
It ease theuserâ€™s experience and save more time when they are completing the CATPCHA.
In this study, we made a quiz which has four different types of CAPTCHAs and separated them into four sets according to their type. 
Then, we recruited two different ages groups to complete the quiz and one questionnaire. 
We used R studio to analyze and organize data to achieve our goal which to find a CAPTCHA format that is the most easily used or the most user-friendly for the age groups covered by this study. 
A relatively suitable CAPTCHA would entail using less response time and having a high accuracy rate. 
At the same time, participants have fewer questions when finishing the task. After analyzing the data, we believe that the calculation question CAPTCHA is more suitable for the two age groups in the study.
